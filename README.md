# AXIL_paper

This repository contains code for the paper "Instance-based Explanations for Gradient Boosting Machine Predictions with AXIL Weights"

AXIL.py contains functionality for fitting to a LightGBM model and training data (Explainer.fit()), and constructing AXIL weights for a data set (Explainer.transform())

NOTE: This is experimental code for research purposes. Functionality may change without warning.

Feel free to send any comments / suggestions to p.geertsema at auckland.ac.nz
